# Project SarVik

Abstract-
Occupational workers carry wearable sensors for radiation dose data logging, datasets are generated due to movement of workers.A computer code running on GPU/CPU is required which can solve reverse Boltzman Transport Equations(BTE) in offline mode using collected datasets (X,Y,Z,Dose) for given area & do 3D visualization of radiation source in that area. 
Radiation protection program can take corrective measures for removal of unwanted sources.
